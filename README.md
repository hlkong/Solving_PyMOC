# Solving_PyMOC

This repo contains a jupyter notebook which: 

- solves two numerical models, PyMOC and the two-layer model

- visualizes the solutions to compare with the results from a more comprehensive climate model, MOM6.

Please note that the code is far from industry standard, since its pure purpose is to create analysis that aids my understanding of the physics behind these models. Therefore, you may find it filled with jargons and un-defined abbreviations...
